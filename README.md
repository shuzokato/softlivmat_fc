# soft/living matter fanclub
A repository for automated posting of the soft/living matter fanclub ([@softlivmat_fc](https://twitter.com/softlivmat_fc))

The codes are implemented in Google app script. All article data is stored in [google spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQbuHXoyAPtPZTyroM-FWdZnM9L2aUoUjAPHJrzEkSCZi3A6zBceW9bxYA2RANR8wrj8R_mF6lJ3rxO/pubhtml)). App script fetches the latest data in the sheets and post them via X (formerly Twitter) API. The posts are delivered around 11 AM UTC on weekdays, but sometimes later due to the operational delay.

We are covering the following journals and preprints.
* Physical Review (Letters, E, Research, X, X Life)
* PNAS (, Nexus)
* Nature (, Communications, Physics, Cell Biology, Materials, Nanotechnology, Communications Physics)
* Science (, Advances)
* Elife
* Soft Matter
* Arxiv (cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech)
* bioRxiv (Biophysics)

The database is updated manually as of Jan 2024, but we plan to fully automate the process in the future. We welcome feedback and helpers for the improvements. Please feel free to reach us a DM or email (shuzo.kato.phys[at]gmail.com).
