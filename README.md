# automated_tweeting_softlivmat_fc
A repository of automated tweets from the soft/living matter fanclub ([@softlivmat_fc](https://twitter.com/softlivmat_fc))

The codes are implemented in Google app script. All article data is stored in Google spreadsheets database ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQbuHXoyAPtPZTyroM-FWdZnM9L2aUoUjAPHJrzEkSCZi3A6zBceW9bxYA2RANR8wrj8R_mF6lJ3rxO/pubhtml)). App script fetch the latest data in database and tweet them via Twitter API.

Currently, we cover the following journals and preprints.
* Physical Review (Letters, E, Research, X, X Life)
* PNAS (, Nexus)
* Nature (, Communications, Physics, Cell Biology, Materials, Nanotechnology, Communications Physics)
* Science (, Advances)
* Elife
* Soft Matter
* Arxiv (cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech)
* bioRxiv (Biophysics)

Currently database is updated manually but we are considering fully automating this process in the future. We welcome volunteers to help with the improvements.
